## Hi! 
I am a Human Systems Engineering student with a focus in User Experience. I am also a SCAP scholar and I will be continuing my education with ASU by pursuing a Master's degree in User Experience in the fall of 2025. In my time at ASU I have discovered a passion for web development. I have worked with HTML and CSS for a year and started learning JavaScript over the past 3 months. I will be particitpating in a Global Career Accelerator program in the spring where I will earn a certification in HTML & CSS and JavaScript & Web Development. I have experience using tools such as CodePen, Figma, and Balsamiq. My work can be seen by checking out my pinned repositories.
