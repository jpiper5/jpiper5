## Hi! ðŸŒ»
I am a Human Systems Engineering student with a focus in User Experience! I am also a SCAP scholar and I hope to get a job with Starbucks Corporate after I graduate. I have only been exposed to Javascript this past semester but I have enjoyed how it allows me to add functionality to my websites. I want to continue learing JS on my own for personal projects. Some of my hobbies include reading, playing the ukulele, and crochet!
